 Chitin

Chitin column purification is a highly specific affinity chromatography technique used to isolate proteins and peptides that contain a chitin-binding domain (CBD), such as recombinant peptides. The principle relies on the strong, non-covalent interaction between chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, and CBDs engineered into target peptides. By exploiting this natural binding affinity, the method allows selective retention of the peptide of interest while removing other cellular components.

The process begins with preparation of a column packed with chitin - sodium alginate beads. The resin is equilibrated with a suitable buffer that maintains protein stability and promotes optimal binding and elution. Our crude saltiness-enhancing peptide lysates are passed through the column, enabling the CBD-fusion proteins to bind specifically to the immobilized chitin. Undesirable components lacking CBDs flow through the column during the loading phase without binding. Extensive washing steps are then performed to remove any nonspecifically bound proteins, thereby improving the purity of the target protein.

Elution of the bound peptides is typically achieved using proteolytic self-cleavage of  the intein tags that are tagged along with the CBDs in the peptide, which separates the target protein from the CBD without affecting its native structure or activity.

This technique is advantageous due to its high selectivity, mild operating conditions, and ability to yield biologically active proteins in a single purification step. Key parameters such as column bed height, bead size, pH and DTT concentration were optimised to yield highest purity of peptides.
